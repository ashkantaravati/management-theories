Spiritual intelligence is a term used by some philosophers, psychologists, and developmental theorists to indicate spiritual parallels with IQ ([[Intelligence Quotient]]) and EQ ([[Emotional Quotient]]).

[[Danah Zohar]] coined the term "spiritual intelligence" and introduced the idea in 1997 in her book [[ReWiring the Corporate Brain]].

In 2000, in the book, Spiritual Intelligence, author [[Steven Benedict]] outlined the concept as a perspective offering a way to bring together the spiritual and the material, that is ultimately concerned with the well-being of the universe and all who live there.
