Knowledge management (KM) is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on identifying, capturing, evaluating, retrieving, and sharing an organization's intellectual assets. It involves processes, strategies, and technologies aimed at maximizing the value of organizational knowledge to achieve business objectives and gain a competitive advantage in the market.

Importance of Knowledge Management: In today's knowledge-driven economy, organizations recognize the critical role of knowledge as a strategic asset. Effective knowledge management enables organizations to leverage their collective expertise, innovate, make informed decisions, enhance productivity, and respond quickly to changes in the business environment. By capturing and sharing valuable insights, organizations can avoid reinventing the wheel, reduce duplication of efforts, and foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement.
