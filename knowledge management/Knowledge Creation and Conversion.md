According to [[Nonaka]] and [[Takeuchi]]'s SECI model, knowledge creation involves the transformation of individual and collective insights into organizational knowledge. This process occurs through four modes of knowledge conversion:

1. Socialization: Sharing tacit knowledge through direct interaction and observation. [[Knowledge Sharing and Transfer]]
2. Externalization: Articulating tacit knowledge into explicit forms, such as [[document]]s, [[diagram]]s, or [[model]]s.
3. Combination: Integrating and synthesizing diverse explicit knowledge sources to create new insights and innovations.
4. Internalization: Embedding explicit knowledge into individuals' tacit understanding through learning and experience.

Examples of Knowledge Conversion: For instance, in a software development team, socialization occurs when experienced developers mentor junior colleagues, sharing tacit knowledge about coding practices and problem-solving techniques. Externalization occurs when team members document their best practices and lessons learned in a knowledge base. Combination happens when different teams collaborate to integrate various software modules into a cohesive product. Internalization occurs when developers apply the documented knowledge to solve new problems and improve their skills.
